Unsupervised sleep stage classification is designed to utilise the time series analysis and neural networks for more efficient classification algorithm. The project is MATLAB based with requires several MATLAB toolbox including EEGLAB, MatConvNet and HCTSA developed by......
Start with Pre_HCTSA.m which reads .edf data into .mat file and perform pre-processing steps of the analysis. Change the name of the data file to be analysed. Then, HCTSA will be run, this step is not included in this repository as it is external..??
